description: Drafts and publishes GitHub or GitLab releases with curated release notes. Use when the agent needs to prepare release text, compare tags, summarize release changes, or create a release. Always use this skill when the user asks to create a release, draft release notes, publish a release, summarize changes for a version, update a changelog for a release, or anything involving GitHub or GitLab releases. Trigger for phrases like "release notes", "draft a release", "publish release", "create a release", "v1.x.x release", "what changed since last tag", or "prepare release text".

# Git Release Skill

> Skill instructions for preparing release text and publishing releases with the matching forge CLI.

This skill is reserved for release work. Use it only when the user asks for a release, a release draft, or
release notes.

## Requirements

- `git` must be installed and available on `PATH`.
- `gh` is required for GitHub remotes.
- `glab` is required for GitLab remotes.
- If the matching CLI is missing, stop and tell the user exactly what is missing.
- When the project uses agent permission settings, prefer `permissions.ask` for
  mutating git and forge commands, including force-push variants.

## Forge Detection

Before any release command, run:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/detect-forge-cli.sh"
```

Only continue when:

- `FORGE=github` and `MATCHED_CLI=gh`, or
- `FORGE=gitlab` and `MATCHED_CLI=glab`

If the repository forge and installed CLI do not match, stop and report the mismatch.

## Workflow

1. **Check the branching strategy** — read the branching block from the agent instruction file
   (see "Branching Strategy Awareness" below). Determine the correct release flow before
   proceeding. If no block is found, tell the user to run `/setup` and stop.
2. Run the forge detection script.
3. **Validate the release context** per the configured strategy:
   - GitHub Flow / TBD: verify you are on `main` or the tag points to a `main` commit.
     If the current branch is not `main`, switch to `main` and pull the latest before
     tagging or publishing.
   - Gitflow: verify the `release/*` branch has been merged to `main`. If the sync-back
     PR to `develop` has not been opened, remind the user to open one using `/pr`.
4. Inspect tags and commit history to identify the release range.
5. Check whether the repository has a changelog file such as `CHANGELOG.md`, `Changelog.md`,
   or `changelog.md`.
6. Summarize user-facing changes, fixes, and migration notes.
7. Draft release text in the required house format.
8. If a changelog file exists, update it for the new release before publishing.
9. Create the release with the matched CLI only after the text is ready.

## Git Command Subset

Stay within this `git` subset unless the user explicitly asks for more:

- `git tag --list`
- `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`
- `git log --oneline <range>`
- `git diff --stat <range>`
- `git remote get-url origin`
- `git diff --name-only <range>`
- `git branch --show-current`
- `git branch --list`
- `git switch <branch>` (for switching to `main` before tagging)
- `git pull origin <branch>` (for syncing `main` before release)
- `git branch --contains <commit>` (to verify a commit is on a specific branch)
- `git cherry-pick <commit>` (only for TBD just-in-time release branch fixes)

Stay within this file-discovery subset unless the user explicitly asks for more:

- `rg --files -g 'CHANGELOG*.md'`
- `rg --files -g 'changelog*.md'`

## CLI Command Subset

For GitHub with `gh`:

- `gh release create <tag> --title <title> --notes-file <file>`
- `gh release view <tag>`

For GitLab with `glab`:

- `glab release create <tag> --name <title> --notes-file <file>`
- `glab release view <tag>`

## Release Text Rules

- Make the title stable and version-oriented.
- Prefer a curated summary over raw commit logs.
- Group notable changes by theme using conventional-commit intent when possible.
- Include testing only if it is known.
- Include migration, rollout, or breaking-change notes when relevant.
- Add a compare link when the forge and previous tag are known.
- End the release text with the co-authorship line unless the user asks not to:
  `Co-Authored-By: Skrrt Bot <bot@skrrt.sh>`

Preferred structure:

```markdown
## What's Changed

### ✨ Features
- ...

### 🐛 Fixes
- ...

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- ...

### 🧰 Internal
- ...

**Full Changelog**: <compare link>

Co-Authored-By: Skrrt Bot <bot@skrrt.sh>
```

Section rules:

- Omit an empty section instead of filling it with noise.
- `feat` usually maps to `✨ Features`.
- `fix` usually maps to `🐛 Fixes`.
- Breaking changes always get a dedicated `⚠️ Breaking Changes` section.
- `docs`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`, and purely internal refactors usually belong
  in `🧰 Internal` only when they matter to release readers.
- Prefer reader-facing summaries over commit-message restatements.

## Changelog Rules

- Always check for an existing changelog before publishing a release.
- If `CHANGELOG.md`, `Changelog.md`, or `changelog.md` exists, update it as part of the release workflow.
- If the changelog follows Keep a Changelog, preserve its structure and add the new version entry in the existing style.
- If the changelog does not follow Keep a Changelog, still preserve the repository's established style.
- Do not create a brand-new changelog unless the user asks for one.
- Keep the release text and changelog entry consistent, but adapt the changelog to the repository's existing format.

## Branching Strategy Awareness

Before creating a release, check the project's agent instruction file for a
`<!-- skrrt:branching -->` block. Search these locations in order: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
`.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.github/AGENTS.md`. If present, respect the configured strategy:

- **GitHub Flow / Trunk-Based**: Releases are created from tags on `main`. Verify the tag points to
  a commit on `main` before proceeding.
- **Gitflow**: Releases follow the `release/*` → `main` promotion flow:
  1. Verify the `release/*` branch has been merged to `main` via PR.
  2. Tag the merge commit on `main` and create the release with release notes.
  3. Remind the user to open a PR from the release branch to `develop` using `/pr` if not
     already done.
  If the `release/*` branch has not been merged to `main` yet, stop and tell the user to
  open a PR from the release branch to `main` first using `/pr`.

If no branching strategy block is found, tell the user to run `/setup` to configure a branching
strategy before proceeding. Do not guess or assume a default release flow.

## Guardrails

- Never create a release against an unknown forge.
- Never use the wrong CLI for the remote host.
- Never invent release notes from guesswork; derive them from tags, commits, diffs, and user context.
- Never publish a release silently when the user only asked for draft text.
- Stop if the detector reports `unknown-remote`, `no-remote`, or `no-compatible-cli`.
- Never skip updating an existing changelog for a real release unless the user explicitly asks you not to.
- Never use `git push --force`, `git push -f`, or `git push --force-with-lease` as part of the release flow.
- Treat release creation as a human-approval action when the project uses agent permission rules.
